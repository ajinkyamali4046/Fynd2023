Nodejs is a JavaScript runtime JavaScript engine. 
Here is the working of event lop:


The architecture is I/O model that makes it for building, high-performance applications.
At the heart of Nodejs is the event loop, which is responsible for handling all I/O operations in Nodejs. 
The event loop is a loop that continuously checks for pending events and executes their corresponding callback functions.
When Nodejs starts, it initializes the event loop and runs any necessary setup code.
The event loop begins by checking the event queue for any previous events.
When an event occurs, such as a user input or a request, it is added to the event queue.
The event loop checks the event queue and selects the next event to process.
if the the non-blocking I/O operation is complete, its corresponding callback is added to the event queue.
The event loop then selects the next event from the event queue and executes its corresponding callback functiob.
This process continues until there are no more events in the event queue.
